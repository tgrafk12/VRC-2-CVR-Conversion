# VRC-2-CVR-Conversion
My current pricing points on converting avatars from VRC to CVR

__VRC to CVR AVATAR CONVERSIONS__

Hi there! Welcome to my little page!

I would be doing this for free, but being unemployed for over a year and a half, and homeless for 6 months cause of mental health issues really takes a toll on someone. 
I'm doing this for the community and out of love for communities like ChilloutVR and VRChat as they gave me a home and family when I most needed it.

I have been doing Unity work since 2019, and love/hate (hate cause Unity loves to be unstable) working on avatars. Seeing how creative people can be is so amazing, and inspires me to make my own stuff. (At the same time, people really need to optimize stuff, but thats a rant for another day)

My goal at the end of the day is to give YOU an avatar that you can work with on your own, or an avatar you can wear in ChilloutVr.

If you require an upload, I will refuse to take your password (ABI Content Creation Kit Master Key) as a way to give you the avatar. (See: [Uploading An Avatar To ChilloutVR](payed-conversion.md#UPLOADING-AN-AVATAR-TO-CHILLOUTVR)) 


## Converting an Avatar (Prices)
Flat $5 for each Avatar (for now, a max of 2 per user so I'm not overworked)

Included in flat price
- Disk Space (Dedicated Unity Project for me to edit for you)
- Shader conversion (single pass to multi pass for VR compatibility on CVR)
- Converting animations and Animator layers to be used in CVR (Does not include GoGoLoco, as there's not a working way for it yet. Down the line this will be included)
- Adding Essential components for Avatar upload (Eye placement, Mouth Visimes, Advanced Avatar Selection, Tagging, etc.) *Custom eye blinking animations and gestures are included, please make sure to tell me if this is the case, otherwise you might have a weird looking avatar when speaking or looking around!*
- Custom Avatar Upload Image (A SFW image, *can be slightly suggestive*)

When I am finished with your Avatar, you may choose one, or both of the selections I provide you...

- A UnityPackage with the converted avatar (Ether Google Dive link, or inside Discord)

Or

- A dedicated upload to "*my*" account, and avatar is Shared to you. (See: [Uploading An Avatar To ChilloutVR](payed-conversion.md#UPLOADING-AN-AVATAR-TO-CHILLOUTVR) for more details) 

## Adding Physics

ChilloutVR does not support Physbones. 

Physbones are a VRChat only script that is only associated with VRChat, and is not distributed to any other VR-Platform. This means, that we need to use other scripts to add physics.
The only Physics editing scripts that are whitelisted for CVR Avatars are ether Dynamic Bones (Not Recommended but affordable) or MagicaCloth (Recommended)


### +$4 to total price For Dynamic Bones - Not Recommended for compatibility on any avatar, but is an affordable option.
(If you own Dynamic Bones, you must include it in your UnityPackage to me or proof of *Unity Asset Store* purchase - Adjusted Price for owning the package = $2)

Includes:
- Adding Dynamic Bones on *most* parts of the avatar. 
**You MUST mention in the work order where you want Physics**.
Max limit of 3 Hair structures. (due to how heavy some dynamic bones are, I'll only be adding a few  because they are terrible to use)
- Dynamic Bone Colliders: To interact with the Dynamic Bones

***If you choose to receive the package when the conversion is done, I will not export DynamicBones in the package the client receives. You (The Client) are required to have the DynamicBones unitypackage before uploading it yourself. I will NEVER distribute copyrighted materials** 

Or 

### +$8 to total price for adding MagicaCloth - Highly Recommended for compatibility on future versions of CVR. 
(If you own MagicaCloth, you must include it in your UnityPackage to me or proof of *Unity Asset Store* purchase - Adjusted Price for having the package included = $4)

Includes:
- MagicaCloth Physics for each part of your avatar that you mention.
**You MUST mention in the work order where you want Physics**.
 (Breasts, Butt, Hair, etc.)
2 Hair meshes/armature structures are included with the Initial price, +$1 for each additional hair mesh/armature *(This is to keep things optimised and let everyone see your avatar at its best possible state.)*
- MagicaCloth Colliders for each Cloth component. - These will be added to the best of my ability **See photos** *(if the rigging is not met to my standards which are pretty high cause I'm very picky about avatars. The extra work may be brought up with person on purchase) `It's not required, but HIGHLY recommended to get the best placement of physics for better user-2-user interaction/collisions`*

(The price for MagicaCloth might be less expensive later on but 95% of the $8 goes towards paying the maker of MagicaCloth to support their work further, and the 5% is the time and effort it takes to manually add colliders and mess with physics. *This can take upwards of 4 or so hours dedicated to one avatar*)

***If you choose to receive the package when the conversion is done, I will not export MagicaCloth in the package the client receives. You (The Client) are required to have the MagicaCloth unitypackage before uploading it yourself. I will NEVER distribute copyrighted materials** 

Adding extra work to the avatar, including but not limited to, 
- Adding prefabs (Standard meshes, or anything else to an avatar thats not required for a successful upload)
- Extra Toggles (Animations and/or complex state machines)
- Editing animations & animation states
- Adding extra Meshes in blender (meshes that require rigging)
- Optimizing (Atlasing Textures, Merging Meshes, removing 0-weight bones, etc.)
- Custom textures (most likely will not do this, but I might feel entitled to add something to improve the avatar you provide. *at clients's request*)

Anything stated on this list will be discussed in a DM with me, and added to the final total at the client's request. (I Will NOT unfairly add extra fee's! I believe in everyone having an avatar they enjoy in game. Anything that is discussed in DM's that can affect the price will be a pinned message with the reason and price added along with the total price. 

It will look a little like this:
```
+/- $amount = "agreed reason for price adjustment"
Total Price with added reason above = $total
```
The listed extra work is something I'm not entitled to do for you, but if I'm bored enough, and the price is fair, I will be totally down to do it. (I might feel generous and do the extra mile work for you for no added charge. *See [TOS](payed-conversion.md#my-tos)*)


# UPLOADING AN AVATAR TO CHILLOUTVR

In ChilloutVR, the game gives users an option to give other users privite access to other's content. Meaning you access to the avatar (Avatar Sharing) privitely instead if it being public unlike VRChat. This option gives you access to wear the avatar and enjoy it as you would normally without people trying to clone it off you. 

However, This does mean that I (Zeia Nala) "own" the avatar. **! Which can run into Avatar Creator TOS !** (*see [TOS](payed-conversion.md#my-tos) #2*) If I were to upload your avatar to my account, I personally will refuse to use it in public worlds (It is your property, which I will not touch or claim to own personally). If the client gives me consent to using the avatar in a showcase of my conversion work, or to showcase to other future clients as an example of the conversion work I am capable of.

Down the line, there will be a feature available for all users on ChilloutVR to transfer access to the avatar entirely. The feature is on the back burner and will be released publicly, *eventually*. **It would be an honor of mine, to fully give access to the client once that feature is released.** Ether I will mention it to all my clients who have had an avatar uploaded by me, or they can contact me about it and I will give them that full transfer to the avatar.


> [!IMPORTANT] 
> IF YOU ARE UNDER 18!!!
> 
> **I HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE AN NSFW AVATAR UPLOAD TO A MINOR!!!**
> 
> ChilloutVR has a Mature Content Bundle (DLC) listed on the Steam Store Page found on the ChilloutVR page [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/661130/ChilloutVR/). 
> 
> If you can't see the Mature Content DLC and you are under 18 years of age, that is a good sign. I will NOT give access of NSFW content to minors. If an avatar you give me to upload is an NSFW avatar, I REQUIRE your SteamID, and a screenshare or screenshot of you owning the Mature Content DLC from your Steam account. 
> 
> If you are above 18 and do not see this DLC, you will need to verify your age on Steam, and then show mature content in your Account settings. I WILL be checking EVERY AVATAR that comes my way for NSFW content.
>
> I do this to ensure that minors are protected in this community and do NOT have access to any Mature Content to protect the minors in our communities.


# My TOS
I'm not going to sugar coat my TOS. I have it simple for a reason, if you take advantage of it I can refuse to provide service. *I'm a human being here just like you, so treat me like one please :<*

#### All edits to my TOS are pubic (GitHub Commits), so if anything is to change it is shown publicly. Current clients will be informed of the changes if an avatar is currently in conversion.

1. I do not support uploading or converting avatars that are intended to crash users. 
   - It's basically impossible here, so I don't allow it

2. PLEASE check with the avatar creator if someone else other than the client can upload the avatar for you.
   - I keep my word on actually deleting files unlike most uploader's that claim to delete, but keep the files. *I have my own avatars I enjoy and edit/create, I don't need more that I don't use.*

3. I will NOT give a Minor (a client under 18 years of age) access to a NSFW Avatar
   - (See: Important Section above)
 
4. If you are rude to me, I can and will refuse to convert and or upload 
   - (I will uphold all avatar TOS and delete any files if the transaction is a no-go)

5. ***Everyone*** is a person to me, I do NOT discriminate. I will treat you how you treat me, with the same level of respect and humanity as you give me.

6. Informing me that you are an "Adult" (Over 18 years old) will allow me to upload NSFW avatars for you.
   - ***ALL MEMBERS THAT CLAIM TO BE 18+ ARE REQUIRED TO GIVE ME THEIR SteamID, THEIR CVR USERNAME, AND A SCREENSHOT OF THEM OWNING THE MATURE CONTENT DLC WITH EVERY NSFW UPLOAD***.
     - I do this to make sure that all content I upload is in the right hands and that Minors are not lying about their age. I will be required to make a moderation request to Alpha Blend Interactive if a client is a minor and has acquired the Mature Content Bundle DLC.

7. All Transaction are FINAL.
   - The ONLY condition I have, is that if we (Both the client and Zeia Nala) come to an agreement of a charge-back or refund
     - I do this as a community service, and I WOULD do this for free if I could afford it, but I really cant :/
       - I can refuse service to a member that is trying to scam me for my time and help to get them started into ChilloutVR. Again, I do this as a community act, and try to be fair and reasonable with pricing
       - Clients can discuss a price with me (Zeia Nala) at any time if they feel like it is too much. I will do my best to lower it as low as I can go, I'm doing this out of my own time in the day.

8. Conversations with client will be on Discord.
   - For client-transaction safety, any messages you edit or delete are saved on MY end. I do this to solidify evidence of any changes we discuss in the Direct Messages. (This is NOT used against you for any discrimination or to get more money out of the client, I really try my best to give you a better chance at value)

# Where to Contact?
I will have a Google Fourm open for people to enter in their information. I'll really only ask for what you need done on the avatar, how I can contact you (Discord username), and most likely will ask for your ChilloutVR name, and SteamID to uphold my TOS. 
Please allow me up to 24-48 hours to check my emails and responses.
